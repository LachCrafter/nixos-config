# nixos-config

Here, I'm publishing my NixOS configuration.

This is the configuration for my main system that I use, I also have a laptop where I'm currently using Arch Linux but a switch to NixOS is planned.

As you can see in the configuration, that I use an Nvidia card.
I use the open version of the driver (open-dkms).
Because of this, I use `nixos-unstable` for the packages I use and my system in general.

If you have suggestions, questions or anything else, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
