# nixos-config

Here, I'm publishing my NixOS configuration.

This is the configuration for my main system. I also have a laptop running Arch Linux, but I plan to switch it to NixOS soon.

As you can see in the configuration, I use an nvidia card.
I use the open-source version of the Nvidia drivers (`open-driver-kernel-modules`).
Because of this, I use `nixos-unstable` for both my packages and system.

If you have suggestions, questions or anything else, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
